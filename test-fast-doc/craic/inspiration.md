# What's the craic?

This other tool is an idea about embedding challenges to other devs on the team to improve the code that lives at that location.

My first thought is embedding a tic-tac-toe board in ascii art in a comment calling out the other dev. The tool can show running challenges. The other dev sees the challenge, makes an improvement to the code, and then makes a move in the tic-tac-toe game. This is a way to get several rounds of thought from different brains onto an important piece of code and set a clock so as to know when to move on.

My VERY first thought was to embed a chess board. But this has some problems. Maybe your most important piece of code in your entire codebase has a chess game running between your two most senior devs. When that game ends, you make a new chess game in some other important place. 

I view 'mindshare' and 'environment design' as important concepts to our limited ability to keep important things top of mind. This tool attempts to leverage some of the easier to grasp things (an external tool, a game, a challenge) to help us keep important things top of mind.
